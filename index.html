		<!--this way, all the lines can be styled separately-->
		<p class="firstline">Hello this is a line of text</p>
		<p class="secondline"> this is a 2nd line of text</p>
		<p class="thirdline">yet again, another row of text</p>
		<h2>Here is another way to do it with different class and divs:</h2>
		<!--this way, a div can be used to style several lines at a time-->

		<p>Hello this is a line of text</p>
		<p> this is a 2nd line of text</p>
